And be one traveler long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
Because it was grassy and wanted wear
Though as for that the passing there
Oh I kept the first for another day
Yet knowing how way leads on to way
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
I took the one less traveled by
The span of my hips
The curl of my lips
Just as cool as you please
Fall down on their knees		
Fall down on their knees
A hive of honey bees		
Just as cool as you please
A hive of honey bees			
And the flash of my teeth
And the joy in my feet
They try so much
But they can't touch
Or have to talk real loud
It ought to make you proud
The bend of my hair
The need of my care
There is a place where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins
And there the grass grows soft and white
And there the sun burns crimson bright
And there the sun burns crimson bright
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow	
Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go
Ideas with nowhere to hide
An eureka moment inside
Indistinct then becoming clear
Words and pictures comming near
A passage of light to my soul
Inspiration to make me whole		
Can a letter break a heart
Like the look as lovers part
Can a smile from two twinkling eyes
Bring forth laughter, from sighs
Can a hug then melt the ice
Does true love always feel this nice
Can romance begun with a kiss
Conclude in a lifetime of bliss
Chill breath of fall seared scarlet red
Tears well within for comrades long dead
Sunrise ripples across the lake
memories surface as I awake
My fingers reach to touch the sky
where swallows circle,then southwards fly
Love flowers as commitment ties
as mere flirtation flies then dies
Shrieks of seagulls die on the breeze
Choldhood ebbs away on sunlit seas
Flowers of beauty within the heart
festoon the gestures we impart
One crysanthemum lay on his grave
Thus did fortune favour the brave
Speaking volumes of words,unheard
spring flowers in which all senses merge
The requiem slowly brought a tear
stripping each sense of its veneer
Shadows flicker across my eye
blown on the wind,a brown butterfly
Handshakes kisses and fond farewell
with destiny's tears nothing could quell
Dahlia petals on the lawn
dew sodden in the October dawn
Michelmas daises,limp and old
amidst fading leaves now spotted gold
Across the meadow a country stile
contemplative I sit awhile
Amid the eerie dayspring light
yesterday's memories glow so bright
The hands tick around,one by one
tedium ends with the setting sun
Apples overhang the prchard wall
sun kissed drapes now about to fall
Explosives whistled all around
where red petals now colour the ground
On the trail of nows-broken vows
echo to a distant horizon
Beautiful blossom,a welcome sight
Nature's emblem a Spring delight
Bright bonfire coloured leaves all aglow
in Acer Palmtum's Autumn show
The polished blade glides to andfro
Timber echoes in the glade below
Long lazy holidays dry and warm
interlaced by a summer storm
Sunset peeping under a cloud
cloaks the landscape in a scarlet shroud
Unheard their endless sounds and sighs
peircing deep their questioning eyes
Poignant passions on canvas splashed
with emotions displayed un-abashed
Inkwells in desks with lift-uplids
Tables written out with old pen-nibs
Hot summer days bring into view
A Red Admiral and Holly Blue
As November draws to its close
the hedgehogs snuggle in dormant pose
Clouds wine dark in a vivid hue
drift on a sea of celestial blue
Aconites gazing into the sun
beneath dangling catkins finely spun
I watch a swallow swoop and pass
above an old meadow,lush with grass
Awakened mammals desert their holes
rummaging midst the hazel boles
Winding brooklets fill narrow streams
into rivers of my childhood dreams
Stooked up sheaves,midst close growing clover
in wind and rain toppling over
Lives sacrificed for us now free
lie quiet as blossom from a tree
Long twilight days in winter's shade
bring tommorrow's snowdrops in the glade
A whistling wind a scatter of rain
Sounds of night on my window pane
Eyes fill with emotion or tears
stories unravel of yesteryears
Fishing for minnows ith jar and net
oftimes slipping and getting wet
Around narrow streets carl singing
boxes rattling lanterns swinging
Noses pressed flaton the window glass
our pockets tinkling full of brass
Exploring fields across the brook
studying in nature's real time book
Beechwood downlands and common heath
with earthy limestone inches beneath
Daisy buttercup yellow cowslip
together mix in fellowship
Purple vetch and ribwort plantain
jostle lush clover in Enlish rain
Dogrose flowers in a briared sprawl
prickles as it meanders tall
Follow the track with the scenic view
into the wood with its carpet blue
Speckled starlings sing with delight
over flying ants in nuptial flight
Stone bridged hamlets nestle in the Dales
with stone walled fields along their vales
By a trickling stream so shallow
willows shadow a purple mallow
Sea Buckthorn in a dense hedge screen
between Ceanothus shaded green
Scents to mingle in summer heat
Jasmine Honeysuckle Bittersweet
Sensations tingling up the spine
as heaving emotions re align
Moth butterfly we briefly see
conserved by us their steward trustee
Clouds of teasels spiral so tall
amidst dancing grasses against a wall
The stream where pooh sticks once were raced
now flows into memory's embrace
Sounds of lonely ejected sighs
erupt from ruts in life's highways
Lilies waxing in summer light
A heady fragrance to fill the night
The perfumed petals,paperwhite
first intoxicate then delight
Over striding downs with grassy scrub
and onto the trees with clumps of shrub
Along shaded lanes with gates and stile
and wayside pubs to rest awhile
Daybreak tinges the nigescent sky
Hope enlightens my mind's eye
Queen and drone in ceremony
wag and dance with alacrity
Meadow Brown,Peacock and Skipper
welcome pollen dusted day tripper
Cauliflower clouds nimbus topped
weeping a shower of warm tear drops
The Basil spreading six feet tall
by a freshwater spring trickling small
Patios parasol be decked
Wandering wasps pinicing un checked
Between clumps of gorse in yellow garb
Along a path baked summer hard
Lucky is a pretty kitty
But at times she can be very witty
Martin Luther King was not a king
He did not have horses a crown or anything
He preached a lot and had a dream
Of everybody eating ice cream
Somebody set my heart afire
Somebody filled me with desire
Somebody set my heart afire
A handsome man I still admire
Somebody set my heart afire
and I was sinking into the mire
This day what future will it bring
What songs will we finally sing
Snow quietly gracing the ground
There will then come a silent sound
We will be skating on the pond
And every one will form a bond
By crackling fire we'll gather around
There will then be a silent sound
No recipe will we follow
Flitting the night with the swallows
We'll form a ring around around
There will then come a silent sound
True wit is nature to advantage dressed
What often was thought but never so well expressed
Whether or not we find what we are seeking
is idle biologically speaking
Wherever you find the cooling western breeze
In the next line it whispers through the trees
If crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep
The readers threatened not in vain with sleep
Oh could I flow like thee and make thy stream
My great example as it is my theme
Though deep yet clear though gentle yet not dull
Strong without rage without overflowing full
Her lofty courser in the court below
Who his majestic rider seems to know
Proud of his purple trappings paws the ground
And champs the golden bit and spreads the foam around
My Tyrians at their injured queen’s command
Had tossed their fires amid the Trojan band
At once extinguished all the faithless name
And I myself in vengeance of my shame
And then black night That blackness was sublime
I felt distributed through space and time
One foot upon a mountaintop one hand
Under the pebbles of a panting strand
One ear in Italy one eye in Spain
In caves my blood and in the stars my brain
There was a little hermit crab
Who thought his tank was rather drab
At first he didn't know what to do
Then decorated with pink and blue
Now he is no longer crabby
With his new home he's rather happy
My feelings for you no words can tell
Except for maybe go to hell
Oh loving beauty you float with grace
If only you could hide your face
Kind intelligent loving and hot
This describes everything you are not
I want to feel your sweet embrace
But don’t take that paper bag off of your face
I love your smile your face and your eyes
Damn I’m good at telling lies
I see your face when I am dreaming
That’s why I always wake up screaming
My love you take my breath away
What have you stepped in to smell this way
I thought that I could love no other
Until that is I met your brother
