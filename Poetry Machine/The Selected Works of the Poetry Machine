our pockets tinkling full of rain 
and  ribwort  plantain  
two twinkling eyes fill the prchard wall 
spring  trickling  small  
where swallows circle,then southwards fly 
what  songs  will  the  need  of  gorse  in  my  mind's  eye  

i was grassy and net 
beechwood  downlands  and  drone  in  a  swallow  swoop  and  getting  wet  
a tree 
fall  seared  scarlet  red  petals  now  free  
with old meadow,lush with a tear 
he  preached  a  heady  fragrance  to  its  veneer  
welcome pollen dusted day 
yet  knowing  how  way  
conserved by 
long  i  

sounds of my soul 
lives  sacrificed  for  another  day  what  future  will  it  ought  to  make  me  whole  
cloaks the landscape in acer palmtum's autumn show 
explosives  whistled  all  aglow  

a pretty kitty 
patios  parasol  be  very  witty  
a spring flowers in ceremony 
with  alacrity  

daybreak tinges the bend of my heart 
memories  surface  as  lovers  part  
cloaks the track with desire 
cloaks  the  mire  
first for another day 
ideas  with  nowhere  to  way  


our pockets tinkling full of my heart afire 
the  mire  
this day 
yet  knowing  how  way  
a lot and there 
and  wanted  wear  


yes we'll go 
the  meadow  brown,peacock  and  slow  
the stream so much 
my  fingers  reach  to  touch  
purple vetch and the ice cream 
and  there  will  then  come  a  dream  
amidst fading leaves now free 
he  preached  a  tree
